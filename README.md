# A framework for modular and easy to understand energy modelling tools

`clio` aims to be a collection modularisation guidelines and tools that help energy modellers produce high-quality research that is repeatable, understanable and easy to use.

Please read all about it in our [documentation](https://clio.readthedocs.io/en/stable/)!
